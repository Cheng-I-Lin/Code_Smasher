                <strong>General Instructions:</strong><br>
                There is a total of 5 different games modes you can choose, each with a different way to play. To start, click
                on the shapes corresponding to the titles of the game. To play the game, use the keyboard controls on your computer 
                and the mouse and follow the corresponding instructions for each game mode. By clicking the "BACK" button on the 
                screen, the game will end and the screen will be transitioned back the title/introduction screen.

                <strong>Protect the Bubble:</strong><br>
                In Protect the Bubble, players would control the movements of a bubble(circle) using the mouse. However, there will be
                obstacles moving down which the player has to avoid by moving the bubble to a safe spot where it would not come in
                contact with the obstacles. Keep the bubble alive and try not not to burst it. The longer you do so, the more
                points you would score.<br>

                <br><br>
                <strong>Square Up:</strong><br>
                Square Up is a two player game where each player would use either the arrow keys or the W, A, S, and D keys to control
                the movements of a square. Each player can move the square left to right and can also make it jump. Moreover, by pressing
                either the S key or the down arrow key, the square will shrink, becoming a smaller square with a faster movement speed.
                The objective of this game is to try to jump on top of the other player's square, and the first to do so wins.<br>

                <strong>Trinity:</strong><br>
                The game of Trinity is a game that requires absolute precision and concentration, testing the limit of your 
                memory. In the game, there will be three triangles, which would light up in a timely and orderly fashion. After one of
                the triangles lights up, the player must click on that very same triangle. If the player did not press on the correct
                triangle, then the game is over. However, clicking on the right triangle proceeds the game, where another triangle
                would again be light up. It is up to the player to remember to pattern of all the triangles that lighted up and click
                on them in order of the light up sequence. The number in the middle would show the total score.<br>

                <strong>Addition Equation:</strong><br>
                In this game, a secret 3-digit number will be randomly generated along with an addition equation that leads up to the
                secret number answer. The objective of the game is to try to guess the correct formula at obtaining the secret number,
                which the player will be given a clue shown on the screen. Each guess will be surrounded by a green, orange, or white colored box. A green box
                indicates the number is used and placed in the correct position in the formula. An orange box indicates the number is
                used but not placed in the correct position. A white box indicates the number is not being used at all in the equation.
                If a digit is not used, just fill in 0 for the corresponding box. To check for the answer, press enter.<br>

                <strong>Code Smasher:</strong><br>
                Just as its name suggested, Code Smasher includes the smashing of some blocks, which are programmed by codes. In the 
                game, there will be a hammer moving across the screen, reaching to a target platform zone, which consists of white,
                orange, and green layers. The player would have to react quickily and hit the space bar onces the hammer enters the 
                target zones. Doing so, the hammer would stop moving, and the location on the zone where it end up will add points to
                your total score: white zone has a single point, orange zone has 3 points, and green zone has 5 points. However, if the
                hammer is stopped to early or too late(outside the white zone), then the game will end.<br>
